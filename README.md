# Instagram RESTful API

Our final project will be modeled off of the Instagram API. Instagram itself, is a free social media platform that allows users to share photos and videos. It has become hugely popular focusing on visual connection. Users can create/edit/delete posts, comment and like other posts, create Instagram stories and reels, and so on. Each user has an Instagram profile that stores all of their information and content. Other users can follow a user’s profile to see the content that they publish. Instagram provides each user with a main feed where they can scroll through their friend’s media, as well as a search and explore page, where users can find and browse content from anyone on the app.
